# Online Anonymity Basics:

Part of online security is maintaining anonymity for certain operations.  It's no secret that Social Media utilizes "Big Data" to profile its many users as part of specialized and targeted advertising.  Google, for example, reserves the right to read any and every email to go to a gmail account for marketing purposes.  Although it is currently illegal to do so, it isn't hard to imagine a time in the near future where your data is used by Insurers as part of an overall risk assessment.

Furthermore, whistle blowers in the US don't have a great track record as of late.  However, when an individual is compelled to speak out due to his or her integrity, integrity doesn't count the costs.  Therefore, remaining anonymous is crucial to a whistle blower's well being.

## TOR/VPN:
Tor, formerly "The Onion Router", is an encrypted, anonymizing network initially developed by the US Navy, DARPA, the CIA and NSA as a means of providing anonymity online.  It requires specialized software that is freely available and free to use.  Tor's protocol's are nearly unbreakable and were used by Edward Snowden to escape notice by the NSA.  While it requires users to act intelligently, any intelligent user is protected from de-anonymizing attacks at a level that no other service or protocol can provide.  (Caveat:  It is rumored that multiple TLA's track TOR users who deanonymize themselves, and having Tor installed on a computer is considered "probably cause" for investigation)

A VPN is a "Virtual Private Network" that allows its users to access the Internet from anywhere in the world as though the user were located at the VPN's office or exit node.  The strength of a VPN is only as good as its lawyers and/or place of business and should be used with caution.  (Caveat:  it is rumored the NSA & CIA track American users who access VPN's located outside US borders while the FBI & and DHS track American users who use VPN's located inside US borders).

## Encryption:
Encryption is achieved using cyphers to deny anyone without the cypher the ability to read a message.  There are various protocols for achieving encryption, with Public Key/Private Key Pairs being the most common.  PGP (short for "Pretty Good Protection") is the current standard for Public/Private keys and is an open-source protocol that can be utilized on any laptop or desktop computer for standard communication channels.  On mobile devices, both Android and iOS have access to a few different encrypted communication apps, including FB Messenger and WhatsApp.

## TAILS:
The Amnesic Incognito Live System is an operating system that is installed on a USB thumb drive and then used to boot on nearly any PC or Laptop that routes all network traffic through Tor, so that no de-anonymizing leaks are possible.  And because the OS is on the thumb drive, unles a user specifically interacts with a PC's hard drive, there are no records of TAILS ever being used on a system.  No even or error logs on the native system will every show that anyone used the machine at that given time.

## OpSec:
The biggest weakness in every operation is people.  Maintaining proper Operational Security is crucial to any and all attempts to maintain anonymity.  It is very rare that a technical failure of encryption leads to a discovery or arrest.  It is almost always because a very intelligent person made a very stupid mistake.  OpSec includes the use of the proper tools AT ALL TIMES while maintaining the integrity of communications by using proper passwords, key phrases, and other authentication means.

## Threat Assessment:
The types of measures necessary are directly proportional to the sophistication of the adversary.  A spy or whistleblower seeking to evade a state-sponsored actor needs every tool at his disposal, while a husband or wife seeking to cheat on their spouse probably needs just the most basic of tools.  Assessing the amount of scrutiny one expects to face is critical in maintaining good OpSec, as jumping through needless hoops will lead to OpSec-Fatigue.  This Fatigue will inevitably invite mistakes that would otherwise not happen.
