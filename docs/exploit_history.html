### The Red Queen's Race
>"Well, in our country," said Alice, still panting a little, "you'd generally get to somewhere elseâ€”if you run very fast for a long time, as we've been doing."

>"A slow sort of country!" said the Queen. "Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!"

As technology has evolved, criminals have evolved with it.  From shaving coins in Mesopotamia to the latest click-fraud-laden, bitcoin-mining rootkit on the internet today, those with ingenuity unchecked by integrity will always seek a way to get something for nothing.  Today's interconnected Web2.0 and Information of Things (IoT) environment provides a ripe harvest of stolen identities, cryptowall blackmail victims, and corporate SpearPhishing targets.  But knowledge is power and those who can learn from history *aren't* doomed to repeat it.  Both sides are running as fast as they can, but the Red Queen has had her say in the race.  No one has yet been proclaimed the victor.

####  What has gone before
The first self-replicating program (a fork bomb) was executed at the University of Washington in 1969.  In 1971, the proto-Internet (ARPAnet) was crashed by the first worm, [Creeper](http://virus.wikidot.com/creeper), and then crashed again by Reaper (the first Nematode) a week later.  By 1990, there were 9044 recorded varieties of malware in existence, spread almost entirely in the form of viruses (which only spread by corrupted file execution).

In 1999, the first modern internet Worm was released:   [Happy99](http://virus.wikidot.com/happy99).  It was swiftly followed up by [Melissa](http://virus.wikidot.com/melissa), [FunLove](http://virus.wikidot.com/funlove), and [ILoveYou](http://virus.wikidot.com/loveletter) which caused a staggering combined total $35 Billion in damages to businesses worldwide.

By 2002, worms were no longer the star of the show, having been replaced by Trojan's.  Instead of just causing damage, the new threat allowed a criminal to steal a computer without ever having physical access to the device.  In 2005, AV-Test reports 333,435 unique malware signatures roaming the wilds of the Internet, jumping to 5,490,000 in 2007.  In 2011, AV-Test estimates 75,000 new malware are released daily.  With this many new signatures to test, anti-virus software is facing an uphill battle.

Trojan RATs (Remote Administration Tools) became the exploit of choice for many criminals in 2012.  Utilizing known issues in Internet Explorer, Adobe Flash, and Adobe Reader, the 26 previously released RATs are joined by 20 new exploit kits that same year.  Security patches and new software suites manage to overcome 34 different kits, but 28 new kits are discovered in 2013.



####  The current Trends
Since 2014, the trend in malware has been the dreaded cryptowall.  This type of attack typically works as all Trojan's do, by opening doors for other software.  However, instead of simply allowing Botnet type activity, the RAT next encrypts some or all of the data on a system and posts a message to the user that their data has been encrypted.  In order for the data to be restored, the user must submit payment in crypto-currency (such as bitcoin).  Failure to do so within an alloted time frame will render the files unusable essentially forever.  [Cryptolocker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoLocker) accrued $27 Million in payments before a concerted effort managed to break the crytographic lock.

Beyond cryptowalls, a legion of Botnets plague computers worldwide.  These automated networks provide its controllers with anonymity and large amounts of computational power for a variety of different ends.  One such Botnet, [ZeroAccess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZeroAccess_botnet), commits click-fraud to profit its controllers an estimated $100,000 per day at the cost of $900,000 to businesses paying for ads that were never seen.  Furthermore, the computational power is applied to bitcoin mining, netting an untrackable amount of profit.


####  Life Cycles
Since the first polymoric viruses created with the [Dark Avenger Mutation Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphic_engine), viruses now tend run in families.  From Zero Day to eradication on the net, the average viral family has a lifespan of 18 months.  Adding in the second and third standard deviations, the lifespan of the typical family is 6 months to 2 years.  Very well written families have had lifespans of up to 7 years.  These rarities of viral code are almost exclusively Trojan RATs that create Botnets.  While dangerous to the wrong organization, these Botnets are parasitic instead of destructive.

RATs that include keyloggers, man-in-the-middle or man-in-the-mailbox attacks, banking Trojans are far more harmful to the average PC user.  As such, their lifespan is typically in the bottom half of the above timeframes.  This is despite the fact that so many users do little to nothing to safeguard their systems.

Furthermore, threats themselves have shifted over time.  Initially, viruses were the primary form of computer exploitation.  After a period of roughly 13 years, viruses were supplanted by worms.  For nearly 6 years, worms were the dominant intrusion on the Internet until Trojan Rootkit became the major threat.  The Rootkit was king before the Botnet, spanning an 8 year reign.  Since then Botnets have dominated as the major threat.  Extrapolating forward, sometime in 2017 or 2018, Botnets will likely be replaced by an as of yet unseen threat type, or possibly IoT exploitation (as demonstrated by [Stuxnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet) and [Duqu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duqu_2.0)).  Regardless of the specifics of the next development, the best criminal minds are hard at work to keep ahead of the best anti-virus solutions on the market.

####  Where we go from here
To get ahead, we must heed the Red Queen's advice and run twice as fast.  Instead of blacklisting viral signatures, the latest improvements provide machine learning heuristic analysis of code execution to detect viral code **before** payload delivery.  The same concept applied to network traffic can halt a DDOS or back door penetration before Root exploit can be achieved.

Finally, all the safeguards known to men and angels are useless if someone unlocks the front door to a con artist.  Addressing the vulnerabilities of social engineering are as important as proper software hardening, network protection, and maintaining the proper set of software upgrades to every organization seeking to protect themselves and their clients.
