                        through Gaming</h1>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Billion dollar industrial firms face a host of security threats. From angry employees
                        wanting to exact revenge for perceived insults to Black Hat criminals attacking a firms web presence
                        and digital infrastructure, the varieties of potential malicious actors span a wide spectrum. Beyond
                        Penetration Testing (testing one's information security safeguards), Red Team/Blue Team exercises
                        have become something of the norm for high value enterprises. Borrowed from the military, a Red Team/Blue
                        Team exercise involves one team acting as an attacker (the Red Team, usually an external group hired
                        for that specific purpose) while the Blue Team defends the company's assets. This set up allows for
                        a more thorough understanding of the Blue team's inherent strengths and weaknesses than is available
                        in a simple PenTest. The potential exists that the Red Team fails, not because of the work of the
                        Blue Team, but because it failed to find the right network exploit within the time frame of the exercise.
                        Although this suggests that the Blue Team was properly prepared for the attack, it does <em>not</em>                        prove such. Getting "lucky" in that exercise could prove very detrimental should a determined malicious
                        hacker spend many more hours to find the access that the Red Team could not. An examination of other
                        non-Zero Sum Games could prove profitable in expanding the effectiveness of a Red Team exercise by
                        ensuring that a multi-axial approach to strategy is implemented in the assault.</p>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most successful games in the past 25 years is a collectible card game called
                        Magic: the Gathering (or "Magic" for short). In Magic, each player assumes the role of a nearly omnipotent
                        wizard, known as a Planeswalker, who battles for mastery and control of his or her own section of
                        the Multiverse. Consisting of 60 card decks designed by the players themselves, the game combines
                        traditional high fantasy for stylistic and design elements with tactics and strategy of Chess, Poker,
                        &amp; Go for game play elements, where each player must balance competing requirements in an attempt
                        to amass a board position wherein his opponent is exhausted of any recourse. Although there is a
                        score system (consisting of life totals), games are won or lost based upon the tactical and strategic
                        decisions made both during game play <em>and even before the game began, during deck construction</em>.
                        Choosing to utilize a quick strike force that decapitates the opponent before he or she can enact
                        his or her strategy will sometimes work, but against an opponent prepared for the tactic, such a
                        plan crumbles before it can even begin. In Red Team exercises, social engineering a target might
                        prevent hours of wasted effort in network penetration. Or, it may tip off the target that something
                        questionable is ongoing. In Magic, denying the opponent access to crucial resources is a nasty strategy
                        that has caused much salt, rage, and table-flipping over the years, but it is still used because
                        it works. Physically infiltrating a network access point requires stealth, deceit, or an effective
                        diversion, but it is worth the effort for the Red Team if all inbound connections are prevented by
                        firewall rule.</p>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic has a Pro Tour, including a Word Championship that pays out $250,000 to its winner.
                        Such prizes incite levels of competition that go far beyond just playing the best cards in the hopes
                        of winning. Top Magic professionals spend as many hours per year prepping for tournament play as
                        do professional athletes in the NFL, NBA, or MLB. This amount of study and preparation leads to an
                        interesting meta-game of Paper/Rock/Scissors. The best deck from last month can be exploited by a
                        certain strategy. Does the professional play that deck? Or the deck that beats that deck? Or even,
                        the deck that beats that deck? In Red Teaming, a set of goals are established prior to the exercise,
                        typically of the "capture the flag" variety. Likewise, certain methods, networks, departments, or
                        physical locations are "out of bounds" and not targetable during the exercise. Within those constraints,
                        anything is allowed. The Blue team sets the stage by pre-deploying network and physical safeguards.
                        The Red Team is likely to reconnitor all of these during its initial assessment of the exercise.
                        Even if the Blue Team doesn't tip its hand unintentionally, a skilled Red Team can deduce weaknesses
                        by what's allowed or disallowed. This type of meta-gaming may be frowned upon by the Blue Team that
                        has a vested interest in winning a fair fight, but it should <strong>not</strong> be a fair fight.</p>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A malicious actor doesn't care about fair-he is only concerned with whatever it is
                        that drives his malice. The whole purpose of a Red Team/Blue Team exercise is to investigate preparation
                        for, and responsiveness to, Black Hats. Coming to terms with the meta-game of the InfoSec world is
                        as crucial an exercise as anything else that the Red Team will attempt. Modelling this fact and exploring
                        this model is an ongoing work, both here at Aclecta and at InfoSec firms worldwide.
