                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our previous article, available <a href="http://www.aclecta.com/RT_Magic.html">here</a>,
                        a comparison was drawn between Red Team/Blue Team exercises and Magic: the Gathering in the hopes
                        of increasing the exercise's effectiveness. Probably the most important element discussed was the
                        notion of the Metagame, the game outside the Game or the state of strategy that exists outside of
                        any single match that dictates the card choices a highly skilled Magic player will make to increase
                        his or her effectiveness against a random-but equally-skilled-opponent. The parallel that holds here
                        is that an outside Red Team can conceivably predict weakness in the Blue Team's infrastructure based
                        upon what is considered "out of bounds" for the sake of the exercise. If you haven't checked out
                        the article and you're unfamiliar with the game, take a moment to read it before continuing. What
                        follows below skips over the previous explanations and introduces a few more ideas.</p>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combat in Magic, consists of "creatures" that are summoned from anywhere in the Multiverse
                        to attack your opponent. Dragons make ferocious attackers, but take a while to deploy. Artifacts
                        (magical machinery) can be deployed for a variety of reasons, from ramping up resource production
                        (in order to get your Dragons out faster) to destroying your opponents creatures (to punish your
                        opponent for spending so many resources on one dragon). Casting Fireballs at your opponents face
                        will sometimes win games, but the same fireball directed at Eldritch Abomination might save you from
                        having your face eaten off. All of these elements (and many more besides) work together to create
                        a rich strategic environment, where analyzing your opponent's position is as crucial to victory as
                        proper sequencing the deployment of your own assets.</p>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Magic, it isn't wise to ignore your opponent and what he or she is trying to do
                        to win. A "threat" is any card or combination of cards that if left unchecked will win the game.
                        The "answer" to a threat is "removal", which is a card that takes the threat out of play. That dragon
                        that was so fierce? Casting it straight into the pits of Hades renders it useless. That artifact
                        that deals you 2 points of damage once per turn? If you disenchant it, it goes away.
                    </p>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the paper/rock/scissors of the Metagame, the most simplified breakdown consists
                        of 3 archetypes: aggro, control, &amp; combo. Aggro, short for aggressive, is a deck that tries to
                        eliminate the opponent before they can do anything meaningful–ending the game as quickly as possible
                        in a full out assault. This type of deck packs few answers and instead focuses on presenting more
                        threats, more quickly than any opponent can hope to answer them. Control is exactly what it sounds
                        like. This type of deck seeks to utilize various types of resource advantage while denying the opponent
                        the opportunity utilize resources committed to the board. Combo is short for "combination" and attempts
                        to present some 2 or 3 card interaction that will use an in-game loop to generate infinite health,
                        infinite damage, infinite spells, or some mix thereof. Historically, this type of deck is a glass
                        cannon and loses if the opponent can prevent the cards from interacting as they should.</p>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As new players learn the various elements of strategy and begin to win more, it's a
                        pretty typical experience for the player to see a significant increase in their win rate then shortly
                        thereafter have a precipitous drop in win rate. The increase is due to a more thorough understanding
                        of things like board state, resource conversion ratios, deck construction techniques, etc. The drop
                        that occurs afterwards is because they don't yet see the next important lesson:</p>
                    <h3 class="textc"><a id="There_are_wrong_answers_but_there_are_no_wrong_threats_12"></a>There are wrong answers, but there
                        are no wrong threats.</h3>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the opponent is presenting one major threat per turn, then the first time a threat
                        goes unanswered the game is likely decided at that time. It may take several more turns for the win
                        to be consolidated, but that fact is the battle that wins or loses the war. Addressing the previous
                        paragraph, intermediate level players usually decide to make their decks more resourceful, less linear,
                        and more capable of dealing with complex board states. All of these goals are worthy of pursuit.
                        However, these intermediate players ignore what helped them to increase their win rate: unanswered
                        threats win games, but answering threats only staves off a loss. That distinction is a very fine
                        point that is easy to miss.</p>
                    <p class="textc">That distinction is what separates the local weekend grinders from players on the verge of making the
                        Pros.
                    </p>
                    <p class="textc">That distinction is why, in the typical Red Team/Blue Team exercise, the Red Team usually comes out on
                        top.
                    </p>
                    <h3><a id="A_Moat_an_Archangel_with_a_flaming_sword_and_a_Black_Hat_Hacker_walk_into_a_bar_20"></a>A Moat,
                        an Archangel with a flaming sword, and a Black Hat Hacker walk into a bar...</h3>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they sit down, the Moat picks up his argument from earlier, saying to the Angel,
                        "Sure, you can fly over me but I'm backed up by the solid walls of my castle, and the King's archer's
                        can pick you off before you get close."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Angel ponders this for a moment
                        and says, "You're absolutely correct. But if I hit you 10 minutes before shift change, when the archers
                        are all tired of standing watch and only thinking of going home to soft beds and beautiful wives,
                        your deterrence rate will drop significantly. It is at that point, that the Hosts will descend. No
                        static defense is impenetrable."<br> At this point, the Hacker looks up from his phone and starts
                        laughing. The Moat and the Archangel both look at him like he's lost his mind. Eventually the Angel
                        draws is sword and says, "Listen, fool. God may suffer foolishness, but I do not. What is the jest
                        that drives your laughter?"<br> The Hacker stands up, drops a $20 on the bar, and says "This rounds
                        on me. While you were busy theorycrafting tactics and countermeasures, I hacked both your email accounts,
                        changed your passwords, and sent various orders in your names. The King's archers are on high alert
                        for an incoming Angel assault, posted to every 2nd story window, parapet, and wall station in the
                        city, while the dark elves are creeping up from below. Likewise, the Angels are amassing to attack
                        for the mock exercise, but they're in the wrong city, on the wrong coast of the Kingdom.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The
                        moral here, boys? Don't let the game become the point of the game. If you hurry, you might make it
                        to the capital before the invasion is over."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with that, he disappeared
                        into the darkness.</p>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that there are no wrong threats implies that all attacks are equally profitable.
                        This implication is untrue, both in Red Team exercises and in real world black hat operations. Furthermore,
                        the implication is unintended. What is intended is that perfect operational security is impossible.
                        Computers suffer from the failures of their designers. Staff is limited by funding, availability,
                        or even just experience with the problems at hand. Perhaps what needs to be explored is how the Blue
                        Team can cease waiting behind a wall and a moat, and instead take proactive countermeasures–or even
                        make reactive counterassaults that prey upon the weaknesses of the Red Team's strategy.</p>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How that might be implemented remains to be seen.</p>
