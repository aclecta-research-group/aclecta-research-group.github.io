            <h1 class="block-title m-b-sm">What we do:</h1>
            <h2 class="block-title m-b-sm">Technological Leadership</h2>
            <p class="lead m-b-md text-muted">Navigating the rapidly-and-ever-changing world of IT is beyond the reach of most people, not because of a lack of competence but for a lack of time.  We make your business environment our own, working side by side with you to understand, implement, and utilize what best helps your business grow into the shape you envision.  Effectively, we're the CTO you need, minus the stock options, board seat, and golden parachute.  (Although, we always take stock options when offered.)</p></br>
            <h2 class="block-title m-b-sm">Analytics</h2>
            <p class="lead m-b-md text-muted">Data, both big and small, is what businesses thrive on.  Applying unconventional, novel, and proprietary heuristics to data sets allows insight that would otherwise be missed. That insight may help you overcome your latest slump--or even prevent the next one from occurring.  Building the tools to analyze that data is where we start.  Practical and actionable information is where we finish.</p></br>
            <h2 class="block-title m-b-sm">Infosec, Red Teaming, and PenTesting</h2>
            <p class="lead m-b-md text-muted">The orignal meaning of the term "hacker" meant "one who likes to take things apart to understand them".  Literally, a hacker hacked away the exterior to see what was inside.  Today, a hacker is the enemy, the malicious villain in a Black Hat who shows up to steal, destroy, or extort.  Fortunately, the good guys in the White Hats are on stand by, ready to work with you to protect your assets.  Industry best practices in defensive measures, network penetration testing, and full blown Red Team/Blue Team exercises are the tools we offer, with the expertise to ensure it is done right.</p>
            <h2 class="block-title m-b-sm">Full Stack Software Engineering</h2>
            <p class="lead m-b-md text-muted">From the User Interface (front end) to the database protocols in the cloud or over the network (back end), Aclecta offers the "full stack" of software development & engineering.  Because we enjoy solving problems, we want to work from front to back, beginning to end.   Because we are thorough, the entire project fits within our purview. </p></br>
            <h2 class="block-title m-b-sm">Infrastructure and Desktop Support</h2>
            <p class="lead m-b-md text-muted">Designing software?  That's easy compared to the long term commitment necessary to ensure your day-to-day needs are being met--everyday.  In addition to the tactical and strategic consultations necessary to ensure you have what you need, we offer service contracts to support and maintain your in-place or newly upgraded infrastructure.</p></br>
