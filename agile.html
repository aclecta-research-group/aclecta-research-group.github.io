                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software and computer programming has come a very long way from its early incarnations.
                        In fact, software wasn't even originally software. On the first few generations of computers, programs
                        were actually hardware. Circuits had to be meticulously connected to solve specific types of problems,
                        and then the particulars of each problem had to be entered into the computer's memory through punch
                        cards. Obtaining the solution would then require translating a whole new batch of punch cards from
                        machine language into English. Solving a different problem would require rewiring the entire machine
                        after spending weeks mapping out the specific logic necessary to solve the newest problem. This was
                        the nightmare of using early mainframes.<br> And yet for all these complications, several companies
                        including IBM, AT&amp;T, RCA, &amp; GE made fabulous profits as this system was still better than
                        solving certain problems by hand.</p>
                    <h4 class="textc"><a id="The_Dark_Ages_compilers__double_punch_cards_9"></a>The Dark Ages: compilers &amp; double punch
                        cards
                    </h4>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The software game grew more complicated and much simpler with the addition of
                        compilers. Compilers are a type of algorithm that works with a computer's built-in circuits to determine
                        how the logic of a program should be implemented. This made it so that the computer didn't have to
                        be rewired for each program. This simplification came at the price of one minor inconvenience. The
                        first gen compilers would take the punch cards fed to it by a software engineer, translate the instruction
                        set into machine language, then spit out another (much larger) set of punch cards that the mainframe
                        could understand and operate with. This operation took days instead of weeks, cutting the costs and
                        wait time down to the point that the average Fortune 500 company could afford this service–but only
                        if they <strong>really</strong> needed it.</p>
                    <h4 class="textc"><a id="The_Second_Industrial_Revolution__processors_on_chips_13"></a>The Second Industrial Revolution:
                        processors on chips</h4>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the release of the Intel 8008 processor in 1972, the cost of computation dropped
                        dramatically. Though it had steadily decreased over the decades, the cost of each clock calculation
                        plummeted to new lows. Within a decade, computers were no longer the province of large industrial
                        firms or prestigious Universities but could be had in any wealthy American's office. New users meant
                        new problems to solve. The software industry which had previously been tied almost exclusively to
                        hardware manufacturers now had a life of its own. Many of the big names in the software industry
                        got their start during this time period. Everyone needed word processors, spread sheets, databases,
                        and a host of other things that the new much computers could provide. Just as the introduction of
                        the steam engine led to a whole new economy, the introduction of the microprocessor led to a new
                        economy whose effects are still being explored today.</p>

                        Method
                    </h4>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, projects begin because someone has a vision. "All roads lead to Rome"
                        because the Roman Senate had the vision to see how easy travel would increase the wealth of the Republic,
                        increase taxation, and make Rome more powerful thereby.</p>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But implementing Vision requires a plan. To plan successfully, we must know what is
                        required. Imagine a Roman engineer after hearing the Roman Senate's vote to have all roads lead to
                        Rome,"Build a road that connects everywhere to Rome? I'm sorry, Senator, but that's not feasible.
                        How about a road that connects every city in Italia to Rome, with further roads extending to the
                        capitals of the Provinces and Territories? From there we can require each Provincial Governor to
                        build roads from their capital to all of their cities?" Whether or not that conversation ever took
                        place, it demonstrates the point: Vision is nothing if you can't define what is required to consider
                        it a success. In software engineering, defining the specific requirements that constitute a "solved
                        problem" are frequently the hardest part of the whole job.</p>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After requirements are gathered, reviewed, and approved, design is the next step. Our
                        same imaginary Roman engineer would have sat down with the best maps that the Roman Legions could
                        provide, examined geography for elevation, flood probabilities, population density, available stores
                        for travelling Legions, and many other factors before he began plotting the routes of the Roman Roads
                        Public Works Project. Such careful, meticulous, and intricate examination of the many interconnected
                        issues at the start of the project saves a ton of effort and money later in the project when the
                        unexpected begins to rear its ugly head during construction and implementation. Software is no different.
                        The Roman engineer would have taken his new maps, showing the plans for all the roads and gotten
                        approval. Assuming he did his job well, it would have been approved, funding provided, and work begun.</p>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Build it. Test it. If it works and meets all the agreed upon requirements, offer it
                        to the client.</p>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Senator this time, "Is it straight and true? Did it miss a city by half a mile
                        and now everyone has to make a turn and waste 15 minutes walking an extra 3500 ft? No? Good. All
                        the bridges can hold a Legion in full armor at full trot? Yes? You've tested this? Good. But one
                        last issue… we failed to account for the planned invasion of Carthage. Can you quickly add a spur
                        to Neapolis where the Fleet is marshalling. Our Legionaires report that the existing roads will add
                        2 days to the march. Quickly add the spur before the Spring Invasion."</p>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After it is offered to the client, any feedback provided is used to make final refinements.
                        Once no more refinements can be made, the final product is delivered.</p>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senate has their roads.</p>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is method of software development is known as the Waterfall Method, because each
                        step inevitably leads to the next step. This process is and was the industry standard because it
                        works. It's how projects are managed and run in nearly every other industry, from Construction, Public
                        Works, Engineering, and many others. It's the industry standard because there is no simpler method
                        that is equally effective. Back in the early days of software development, it was the only way things
                        got done.</p>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it's not the only method available now.</p>
                    <h4 class="textc"><a id="Agile_Software__building_solutions_one_step_at_a_time_35"></a>Agile Software: building solutions,
                        one step at a time</h4>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine if the Roman engineer had told the Senator after their design meeting, "Look,
                        we're hard at work on this. But the roads aren't available until they're completed."</p>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senator would have been befuddled and confused, saying something like, "Of course,
                        the roads aren't open until the paving is done."</p>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," says the Engineer, "the roads are unavailable until every last mile is complete.
                        Just because we have pave the road from Rome to Venice doesn't mean it's ready. No one can use any
                        of the roads until all the roads are complete. The system only works when the entire project is complete."</p>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending on the Senator and the importance of that particular Engineer, that Engineer
                        may have been tried for treason and executed for offering so stupid a statement.</p>
                    <p class="textc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software design is frequently modular. Of the many tasks a program may eventually perform,
                        most can be isolated. Agile methodology offers each of these granular modules to the client as they
                        are developed. This has several advantages including a much quicker response time on feedback, adaptive
                        design, typically less expensive than the Waterfall Method, end users are more involved in the process
                        leading to a final product is much closer to what the end users expect or need, and, finally, <strong>not</strong>                        being tried for treason by the Roman Senate.</p>
